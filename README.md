# Bike_Helmet_Detection_using_YOLOv8_CV-Project


This project implements a deep learning-based approach for detecting whether a person is wearing a helmet while riding a bike using the 
YOLOv8 object detection model. The system is designed to assist in safety monitoring by identifying helmet usage in real-time video feeds.
